A Wondrous Instruction for the Moment of Death

by Sakya Paṇḍita Kunga Gyaltsen

To the guru and the protector Mañjughoṣa, I pay homage!

First take refuge in the Three Jewels,Then cultivate bodhicitta, awakening-mind,Visualize Amitābha
before you,And pay homage and make offerings to him.These are the preliminaries.

Generate conviction that your misdeeds have been purified.Let go of all forms of attachment.And
with a mind lacking any fear of death,Practice the meditation on Amitābha.This is the
main part.

Amitābha melts and dissolves into you,So that you take on his essential nature.Dedicate the
virtue to sentient beings.Then train in this all over again.This is the conclusion.

Illness and harmful influences will not arise,And at the time of death there'll be no suffering.In
the bardos you'll be cared for by the buddhas.And thereafter you will attain liberation.These
are the benefits.

This wondrous instruction for the moment of death, which accords with the teachings of the noble
Sakya guru and his sons, was set down in brief form by the glorious Sakya Paṇḍita.
